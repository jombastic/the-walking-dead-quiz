          <h3>Rick Grimes</h3>
          <p>
            Rick is a former sheriff deputy who was shot in the line of duty and fell into a coma, only to awaken and find himself in the midst of the apocalypse. He travels to Atlanta, Georgia, in search of his wife, Lori, and his son, Carl, who have traveled to Atlanta with his best friend, Shane Walsh. After reuniting with his family, along with discovering a group of survivors, he gradually becomes the de-facto leader in their search of a safe haven.

          <h3>Hershel Greene</h3>
          <p>
             Despite his grumpy and cold demeanor, for a significant amount of time, he ultimately served as the moral center of the survivors, being quick to help people whenever they were in need, spreading his influence of hope/reassurance and wanting nothing, but, the best for most of the people around him.

          <h3>Merle Dixon</h3>
          <p>
             A seemingly stereotypical Southern redneck, Merle is extremely ill-tempered, racist, misogynistic, violent, volatile, and quick to express his beliefs. However, Merle is also extremely humorous in nature and is a thrill seeker, who gets joy by mentally and emotionally toying with others. Much like his younger brother, Merle is an expert tracker and hunter. He is deadly with firearms, and in the third season, his hand-blade attachment proves to be one of his deadliest weapons

          <h3>Lori Grimes</h3>
          <p>
             Lori was a strong, selfless, independent, and emotional woman, but was also shown to be difficult and demanding at times. Having believed her husband to be dead, that the world was coming to an end, and trying her best to keep herself and Carl safe, Lori became extremely vulnerable and lonely.
